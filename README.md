# Implementing-Custom-Encoder-Decoder-Model-For-Machine-Translation


Here i build a Sequence to Sequence Model Which translates a Italian Sentence to English.
      
 * Implemented My own Custom Layers(Encoder-& Decoder) with LSTMs in tensorflow Low-level code. 
 * On top of these own Build Custom Layer, I also build my own Custom Model Which process all these Layers and data as per our Needs.
 * I trained this model on Almost 3.5 Lac pair of Sentences. Which Consists a Italian Sentence and their corresponding English Sentence. Here I archived Validation Log-Loss of         0.1934
